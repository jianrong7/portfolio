This article will be about my story on how I picked up front end development skills using The Odin Project (TOP). I strongly recommend this free resource for anyone starting out and hoping to pick up some web programming skills.

_Some projects have been archived. The course materials may have been updated and changed over time._

<br />

## TLDR

- Had almost no web development knowledge
- Lockdown gave me lots of time to start of TOP
- Stopped once lockdown ended
- Restarted in March 2021 with a change in mindset
  > Get 1% better every day
- Completed most of TOP
- Enjoyed and learnt a lot about web development
- Went on to Full Stack Open and self teach about other technologies while creating mini projects along the way to solidify my knowledge

## Pre 2020

Prior to 2020, I had very little programming knowledge, close to 0. All I had done before was update my blog skin and some C++ taught in school. Although I was pretty good at it (I topped the cohort in the subject), the skills taught were largely irrelevant to front end web development.

<br />

## 2020 - Pandemic lockdown

Just like many countries, Singapore also had a nationwide lockdown and suddenly everyone had lots of time on their hands. I wanted to put the time into good use. I started browsing Reddit and looking for good resources to learn programming. At that time, I did not what to use for learning. Lucky for me, the Youtube algorithm gods blessed me with this video. I watched the full 2 hours of it and it guided me about what I should learn. The main takeaway was that I should not worry that much about the resource but instead, I should have the right mindset and put in the effort to learn.
The first thing I did was CS50, the introductory computer science course by Harvard. While I enjoyed it and learnt a lot from it, the skills I learnt did not make me a web developer. Again, I did more searching online and I came across this website called The Odin Project. It seemed pretty well maintained and had a good community behind it.
So, I decided to try it out.

## Odin Project - Round 1

### Foundations

I started the "Foundations" course first because that was what they recommended. The first few articles in that course was mostly reading and setting up your computer. I skimmed through a lot of it, and that was where my mistake was.
In the "Gearing Up" article, they told us to adopt a growth mindset and have perseverance because self learning from scratch was not going to be easy. At that time, I did not pay full attention to that part, and it later came to bite me.
Nevertheless, the introductory part was great. I was learning about Git, a version control system used by almost every developer on the planet. Even the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021 showed that Git was used by more than 90% of developers.

### Google Homepage

After setting all these up and downloading VSCode, my first task was to create a Google Homepage. Hey, that did not seem very hard. I spent about 2 afternoons on this project and was done with it. It wasn't perfect, but HTML and CSS seems pretty doable. I was more motivated now. I could do something!
After that, we needed to learn some real JavaScript, so we were given a very thorough introduction and several practice exercises to get us more familiar with the language.

### Rock Papers Scissors

Soon enough, after learning about the basic syntax of JavaScript and basic debugging, we had our first real project, which was to create an online Rock Paper Scissors game. After looking at what other people had done, I took inspiration from their design and started on the project.
Although I met some problems along the way, it was not a massive roadblock that I could not solve with Google. This project taught me about the Document Object Model and made me more familair with CSS Flexbox, something which became really important as I continued. I even learnt about arrow functions, something which I still did not fully understand at that point of time.
After the project, I learnt more about maintaining clean code. It was very common to refactor code and developers spend most of their time understanding code that was written rather than writing code. Something which I can finally relate to now.

### Etch-a-Sketch

Then, I was tasked to made an online Etch A Sketch. It was an enjoyable project because it reminded me of my childhood. Right off the bat, I had to learn about CSS Grid Layout. I spent a few hours on W3Schools and CSS-Tricks. In the end, I managed to complete the project. I also learnt that CSS Grid is more applicable when you want to display elements in 2 dimensions (horizontally and vertically) whereas CSS Flexbox is more catered towards 1 dimension only.
After this, we went through JavaScript array methods. This was arguably the most important lesson in the course. Methods like map, forEach, some, all, reduce, are all something I still use frequently today.

### Calculator

After that, we were tasked to complete an online calculator. This project was one of the tougher ones so far and I spent a few days completing it. As I tried to avoiding the eval() function for security, it made the codebase much more verbose.
That was the last project in the Foundations course. I felt quite motivated and I was quite proud of myself for being able to complete so many projects within 1 month. However, I had to choose something now. Either go "[Full Stack Ruby on Rails](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?)" or "[Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript?)". Although there was explanation, I consulted Google and Stack Overflow Developer Survey to help me decide. In the end, I decided with "Full Stack JavaScript" because it seemed more interesting with React and Express. I was quite attracted to the idea of learning the "MERN" stack back then.

### JavaScript

The first few lessons taught us about Objects in JavaScript and I learnt that functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, something that still sticks to me when I build applications in JS.
Library
This project was relatively simple. I just had to apply my knowledge of Object Constructors. One bonus thing I learnt was also LocalStorage, something developers use frequently for authentication.
Then, we learnt about Factory Functions and the Module Pattern in JavaScript. This taught me a lot more about the quirks of the language. I was introduced to the idea of scope in JavaScript, which taught me about the difference between var, let and const. I finally understood the difference between arrow functions and regular functions.

### Tic Tac Toe

This was arguably one of the tougher projects in this course. I remember spending more than one week on this project. I had to go through several tutorials, scanning other people's codebases as well as several rounds of frustration. However, this was also the project that I learnt from the most.
Having to search up Youtube tutorials gave me opportunities to see and judge which Youtubers had great content out there and allowed me to begin curating a list of my favorite Youtubers in the dev space. From looking at other people's codebases, I also learnt about the different quirks and habits different people have when coding which was quite interesting, but could also be quite frustrating at the same time. Lastly, I learnt about the minimax algorithm. I was fascinated about being able to implement simple AI in my project and I was finally using the knowledge I learnt from the CS50 course I took previously, recursion!
It was certainly a very exciting adventure but this was also about the time when Singapore began relaxing its lockdown restrictions. I became busier with other commitments and soon, I completely abandoned The Odin Project after getting stuck at the Todo List project.

## Odin Project - Round 2

Fast forward to March of 2021, I bumped into this video on Youtube again. This time, this quote stuck with me. "Get 1% better each day." Over time, the improvements will compound, you will look back and be better than most people who put in 99% effort on the first day and lose motivation the next. That was something I was guilty about. So, this time, I decided to start off small and slowly get back up to speed. During this break, I mostly did Python for data analysis, but it was largely irrelevant to web development.

### All over again

I decided to start all over again although I retained some knowledge. However, I picked it up a lot faster this time. Within a month, I was back to where I left. I felt even better, more confident and more motivated to tackle the challenge ahead.
I learnt about classes, something that I did not use until I learnt React later on. Then we touched on ES6 Modules and Webpack. This time I understood it better and I used this knowledge to complete the Restaurant Page project.

### Todo List

Todo List was definitely a difficult project. It is something that I completed but I still feel like it is not really up to standard. In the future, I plan to restart the project using React and it is a perfect project to showcase my backend skills as well.
The next big challenge came from learning asynchronous JavaScript. Although there was no project, I spent quite a lot of time really digging into promises and understanding it. The resource 'You Don't Know JS' was a great resource. Although it can be a bit dry and technical, it was very detailed and logical. Soon, I learnt how to fetch data from APIs. Then, I picked up async/await, which allows us to write asynchronous code that looks synchronous. This made me appreciate the ever evolving world of JavaScript. JavaScript is constantly improving and it makes me very excited about its future. There are just so many technologies I want to learn in JavaScript.

### Weather App

Building the weather app was fun. I learnt to use async/await and fetch to get data from APIs and display them on my website. However, after this was the part of the course I disliked the most. Test driven development.
Supposedly, 'test driven development' is supposed to be fun. I get that it helps us to debug and helps us to ensure our components are robust. However, having to refactor the tests just because the components have their purpose changed was a bit troublesome, especially for a developer working alone.
Although I could appreciate its purpose, I will probably only use it sparingly in the future.

### React JS

This section is perhaps the most enjoyable part of the course. I still really enjoy React and I am grateful that the React community is so active. Because of React, I could relate to many more content creators online like Ben Awad. State and props were easy to pick up. Handling form inputs using state was also logical. Rendering lists through map() was easy to understand.
This made me appreciate React so much more, coming from a background of vanilla JavaScript. Later, I learnt about the lifecycle of a React component and the various methods like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. Then came React 16.8, which introduced React Hooks. It made class components almost obsolete and became the selling point of React. Hooks are such a great addition and made components much less verbose with the elimination of the 'this' keyword.
After learning about React Router, I completed the Shopping Cart project. This project made me appreciate the e-commerce sites we have today. They are so streamlined and its performance is taken for granted. Companies like Amazon and Shopify enabling businesses to have an online footprint is great. The way they make the onboarding process that simple is even morw impressive.

### Learning about the Backend (Firebase)

Since I did not learn about Ruby on Rails, I decided to use Firebase for the Where's Waldo project. This is one of my best projects to-date. At first, I had dome difficulty setting up Firebase. After a few Youtubeb tutorials, restarts and documentation reading, I finally got it to work.
Wow, I finally reached the end of the JavaScript Course. I learnt about a front end framework, I learnt about a BaaS to host my website and interact with its database. I decided that I wanted to broaden my knowledge by taking up another course called Full Stack Open. It is a modern web development course that dives into teaching you about all you need to know, such as React, Express, MongoDB, Redux and React Native. Such a free resource being offered by another university is truly a blessing for beginner developers. This journey is a story for another day.

## Conclusion

I really really enjoyed The Odin Project. Recently my friends wanted to get into web development as well, the first thing I recommended is The Odin Project. It really starts you off from the beginning. It is structured and project-based, which I believe is very conducive for learning how to code. Although I did not complete the whole course, such as the HTML and CSS part. I think I have learnt enough from Full Stack Open to be able to create my own Full Stack application.
This journey has not been easy, but it was very rewarding. Typing this out made me realize how much I have learnt and The Odin Project was a significant part of that. It has equipped me with some knowledge about web development and motivated me enough to find my own projects and start learning about technologies myself.
If there was one criticism about it, it would be that some projects felt quite pointless because it was just there to learn one concept when it could be combined with other concepts to form one larger project. Nevertheless, I really appreciated the level of detail of TOP and it equipped me well for Full Stack Open and beyond.

So recently, during a frontend engineer team gathering, the VP of Engineering told us this. "If you really want to become better engineers, this will help you a lot. Read Hacker News everyday." He said that Hacker News was filled with the world's smartest engineers sharing their knowledge. Just going on it for a while everyday will immediately make you a better engineer.

Now, I am no stranger to a forum. I frequent Reddit daily. I thought to myself, "maybe I can cut down on 30 minutes of Reddit daily to read 30 minutes of Hacker News". And so I embarked on my journey to read Hacker News.

This article is just a way for me to document some of the interesting articles I have read along the way and my takeaways from them.

## Week 1

[80 days of VR Exercise](https://www.nathanlippi.com/blog/digital-dojo)
With the rise of the 'metaverse', it was intersting to read about how Nathan replaced his daily exercise routine using his VR headset. Apparently, it was pretty good in his experience. It was fun, efficient and it gave him a good workout. Maybe in the future I might try this out.

[Pushups with Python](https://aryanvij02.medium.com/push-ups-with-python-mediapipe-open-a544bd9b4351)
I remember just seeing this in the morning. It's intriguing to see how AI is being used to detect the body and help "replace" physiotherapists. One of the comments even mentioned that physiotherapists are likely to be replaced as they are often just shwoing clients the proper form for movements.
However I think a huge part of the physiotherapists' job is misunderstood. Anyways, I learnt about the existence of Mediapipe and I might use it in the future (maybe in a hackathon).

[95th%-ile isn't that good](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/)
This was a really interesting article from a person with an interesting background. Similar to many of us, he works in tech and has a pretty decent Twitter following.
In the article, he raises several salient points. He uses examples which are relatable to me, such as playing Overwatch, a game I used to play a few years ago.
It made me realise that people participate in a particular activity and practice enough can probably get to the 95%-ile. People who are 95%-ile consistently still makes mistakes
that are easy to observe and correct by the layperson.
My favourite part of the article is that he suggested some meta-techniques for further improvement. He gives 2 simple points.

- Get feedback and practice
  - Can be from anyone, but ideally from an expert
- Guided exercises of exercises with solutions
  - Works mostly for 'old', tried and tested games like chess

[Life advice](https://www.benkuhn.net/weeklyessays/)
Being a relatively young person (turning 21 this year), I am always looking for life advice. I like to listen to the life stories of other people and I especially like to listen
to the life advice they offer. I always want to learn from their experience and make the best out of my life.
This small compilation included the article above (95th%-ile isn't that good) as well as several other interesting articles.
The one that made the largest impression on me is Paul Graham's [Life is Short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html) article. He mentioned to cut out the bullshit. Cut out the 'junk food of experience'.
I agree with him. It is so easy to get sucked into the bullshit of life unless you are vigilant about it. Cut out unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing
with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.

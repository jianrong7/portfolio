So recently, during a frontend engineer team gathering, the VP of Engineering told us this. "If you really want to become better engineers, this will help you a lot. Read Hacker News everyday." He said that Hacker News was filled with the world's smartest engineers sharing their knowledge. Just going on it for a while everyday will immediately make you a better engineer.

Now, I am no stranger to a forum. I frequent Reddit daily. I thought to myself, "maybe I can cut down on 30 minutes of Reddit daily to read 30 minutes of Hacker News". And so I embarked on my journey to read Hacker News.

This article is just a way for me to document some of the interesting articles I have read along the way and my takeaways from them.

## Week 1

[80 days of VR Exercise](https://www.nathanlippi.com/blog/digital-dojo)
With the rise of the 'metaverse', it was intersting to read about how Nathan replaced his daily exercise routine using his VR headset. Apparently, it was pretty good in his experience. It was fun, efficient and it gave him a good workout. Maybe in the future I might try this out.

[Pushups with Python](https://aryanvij02.medium.com/push-ups-with-python-mediapipe-open-a544bd9b4351)
I remember just seeing this in the morning. It's intriguing to see how AI is being used to detect the body and help "replace" physiotherapists. One of the comments even mentioned that physiotherapists are likely to be replaced as they are often just shwoing clients the proper form for movements.
However I think a huge part of the physiotherapists' job is misunderstood. Anyways, I learnt about the existence of Mediapipe and I might use it in the future (maybe in a hackathon).

[95th%-ile isn't that good](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/)
This was a really interesting article from a person with an interesting background. Similar to many of us, he works in tech and has a pretty decent Twitter following.
In the article, he raises several salient points. He uses examples which are relatable to me, such as playing Overwatch, a game I used to play a few years ago.
It made me realise that people participate in a particular activity and practice enough can probably get to the 95%-ile. People who are 95%-ile consistently still makes mistakes
that are easy to observe and correct by the layperson.
My favourite part of the article is that he suggested some meta-techniques for further improvement. He gives 2 simple points.

- Get feedback and practice
  - Can be from anyone, but ideally from an expert
- Guided exercises of exercises with solutions
  - Works mostly for old, tried and tested games like chess

## Week 2

[Life advice](https://www.benkuhn.net/weeklyessays/)
Being a relatively young person (turning 21 this year), I am always looking for life advice. I like to listen to the life stories of other people and I especially like to listen
to the life advice they offer. I always want to learn from their experience and make the best out of my life.
This small compilation included the article above (95th%-ile isn't that good) as well as several other interesting articles.
The one that made the largest impression on me is Paul Graham's [Life is Short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html) article. He mentioned to cut out the bullshit. Cut out the 'junk food of experience'.
I agree with him. It is so easy to get sucked into the bullshit of life unless you are vigilant about it. Cut out unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing
with other people's mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.

[Top performers have a superpower: happiness](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/top-performers-have-a-superpower-happiness/)
This article explored a recent study published in the <i>Journal of Happiness Studies</i>, that the best predictor of good performance is happiness within the US military.
Since the US military is literally the largest employer in the US, by extension, this should apply to other companies as well.
Apparently, well-being is heavily tied to happiness and the largest factor of happiness within the workplace is having a supportive manager. This is nearly <i>twice</i> as important as
the next ranked workplace happiness factor, purpose.
Money was also a great contributor, but only for those who cared about it. So, it turns out that money is really a hollow way to keep employees happy.
The article even included some actionable methods to improve employee happiness.

1. Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates.
   You are probably better off hiring a happy job candidate which will be more likely to be an exceptional performer.
2. Develop happiness in your workforce.
   Unsurprisingly, gratitude and happiness are heavily tied together. By encouraging employees to practice gratitude for a short period of time (1 week), their well-being and
   happiness will show positive change.
3. Retain employees who are happy.
   Happiness, just like unhappiness, is contagious. Keeping happy employees will make the workplace a much happier place.
4. Lead by example.
   Happiness in the workforce works best when the confident leaders are willing to invest significant time and effort into making successful initiatives. We learn best by
   watching others, so "let your employees learn to be happy by watching you".

## Week 3

[The Road to Success is Paved with Rejection Letters](https://perceiving-systems.blog/en/news/the-road-to-success-is-paved-with-rejection-letters)
This article explored the failures of [Michael J. Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Black), a very smart academic, who is the founding firector at the Max Planck
Institute for Intelligent Systems. He tells us a short story from how he was clueless before he got his Bachelor's Desgree until his current position. I can relate to him
deeply. I am also like that. Sometimes, I do wonder whether I can be a good software engineer and whether I am making the right choice taking this degree. But I guess,
even the most successful people will face doubts like that. This article will serve as a source of inspiration for me.

[How to get the most out of your 1:1s](https://erik.wiffin.com/posts/how-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-11s/)
When I saw this article, I immediately clicked it because it was something I can immediately relate to. I just had a 1:1 with my manager and will have more to come in the
future. As I am still the new, the first 1:1 was quite productive but I can see why future 1:1s can get unproductive and feel more like a chore than a useful meeting.
The main thing I learnt about this article is to be daring enough to sound out. Be daring enough to ask whether it is something bothering you, or you wanting more
career growth or even if you want more interesting work. In the end, the things discussed should always be actionable, so that the improvements can be made.

[Lessons from a tech job search](https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/tech-interview/)
I appreciated this article because it went through the applicant's job search process in a short and concise manner yet having useful readings throughout the article.
I love reading about the job search journies of other people because I know how hard it can be to get a job. I will definitely use some of the resources listed out on his
website and will probably start a internship hunt again at the later part of 2022.

## Week 4

[How I learned to stop worrying and structure all writing as a list](https://dynomight.net/lists/)
This article talks about how list-based articles are so attractive to users, which made many SEO spammers cover the web in list-puke. The author then goes on to explain
the phenomenon behind "list-puke", saying that they are appealing, limited in complexity and promises low commitment while delivering value. He then goes on to say that
having a whole article in a massive chunk isn't very appealing for the reader as well. In order to have the benefits of writing a list without actually feeling lame,
just give the piece a non-list title and leave the list items unnumbered, which is actually what I am doing for this article.

[If Google sucks then why is everyone still using it?](https://abhinavsharma.com/blog/google-alternatives)
Other than this article trying to promote their own search engine, I found it insightful that Google search results are actually deteriorating, and this is a growing
concern among tech geeks (aka the Hacker News community). This article realises that people are resorting to communities to ask the questions that really matter.
This is done on platforms such as Facebook and Whatsapp groups, Twitter and Discord. Personally, I feel that Discord is becoming the de-facto place to build an online
community. There is no other better option. I am also guilty of asking more questions that "really matter" on such online communities. However, I never really felt the
degradation of Google search results. As the article mentions that 80% of the population probably do not see it, and I think I belong to the 80% here. However, the author says
that the remaining 20% will be a growing portion, which will be interesting to see in years to come.

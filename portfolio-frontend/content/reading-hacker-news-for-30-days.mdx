So recently, during a frontend engineer team gathering, the VP of Engineering told us this. "If you really want to become better engineers, this will help you a lot. Read Hacker News everyday." He said that Hacker News was filled with the world's smartest engineers sharing their knowledge. Just going on it for a while everyday will immediately make you a better engineer.

Now, I am no stranger to a forum. I frequent Reddit daily. I thought to myself, "maybe I can cut down on 30 minutes of Reddit daily to read 30 minutes of Hacker News". And so I embarked on my journey to read Hacker News.

This article is just a way for me to document some of the interesting articles I have read along the way and my takeaways from them.

## Week 1

[80 days of VR Exercise](https://www.nathanlippi.com/blog/digital-dojo)
With the rise of the 'metaverse', it was intersting to read about how Nathan replaced his daily exercise routine using his VR headset. Apparently, it was pretty good in his experience. It was fun, efficient and it gave him a good workout. Maybe in the future I might try this out.
[Pushups with Python](https://aryanvij02.medium.com/push-ups-with-python-mediapipe-open-a544bd9b4351)
I remember just seeing this in the morning. It's intriguing to see how AI is being used to detect the body and help "replace" physiotherapists. One of the comments even mentioned that physiotherapists are likely to be replaced as they are often just shwoing clients the proper form for movements.
However I think a huge part of the physiotherapists' job is misunderstood. Anyways, I learnt about the existence of Mediapipe and I might use it in the future (maybe in a hackathon).

I got **âœ¨a lotâœ¨** of positive feedback from my [Guide to creating animations that spark joy with Framer Motion](/posts/guide-animations-spark-joy-framer-motion/), and it's undeniable that this library has piqued many developers' interests in the world of web-based animations.

While I introduced in this previous post many of the foundational pieces that compose an animation, and how one can orchestrate multiple transitions very easily with Framer Motion, **I did not touch upon many of the more advanced features that this library provides**.

Ever wondered how to propagate animations throughout several components or to orchestrate complex layout transitions? Well, this article will tell you all about these advanced patterns and show you some of the great things one can accomplish with Framer Motion!

ðŸ‘‰ **Something I discovered while writing this article**

To set the proper direction of the transition, left or right, depending on which button is pressed, I set a state while the user hovers the button which will change the direction of the transition accordingly (not the best implementation I know but it works ðŸ˜„)
Despite this working perfectly on the example on the right, the one that uses `AnimatePresence`, you may have noticed that on the example on the left, the transition kicks in just by hovering one of the buttons.

It seems that `AnimatePresence` keeps track of which motion component is rendered at a given time and throughout state changes.

I still need to investigate the inner workings of Framer Motion for that, but, despite it being a surprise to me, this behavior makes sense given the use case.
